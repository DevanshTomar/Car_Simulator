## Features

- **Autonomous Control**: The car is controlled entirely by an AI using a neural network.
- **Neural Network**: The AI uses a feedforward neural network to make driving decisions based on sensor data.
- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulate traffic on the road to test the car's ability to navigate.
- **Save and Load AI**: Save the best-performing AI model to local storage and load it for future use.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the neural network and sensor data in real-time.

## Technical Details

### Neural Network

The project uses a **feedforward neural network** to enable the AI to make driving decisions based on sensor data.

#### Structure

- **Input Layer**: Receives sensor data as inputs.
- **Hidden Layers**: Each neuron in a hidden layer computes a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias, and applies an activation function.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final driving decisions (forward, backward, left, right) based on the processed data.

#### Feedforward Process

1. **Input to Hidden Layer**: Each neuron in the hidden layer receives inputs from all neurons in the previous layer (input layer), computes a weighted sum, adds a bias, and applies an activation function.
2. **Hidden Layer to Output Layer**: The outputs of the hidden layer neurons are fed as inputs to the neurons in the output layer, which then produce the final driving decisions.

#### Mutation

The `mutate` function introduces variability in the neural network by randomly adjusting the weights and biases. This is crucial for evolving the AI's performance over time.

### Sensor Data

The car's sensors detect obstacles and road borders, providing input data for the neural network. The `Sensor` class simulates the car's sensors using rays.

### Traffic Simulation

Traffic data is stored in a JSON file (`traffic.json`) and loaded into the simulation to create obstacles for the car.

### Visualization

The `Visualizer` class provides methods for visualizing the neural network, showing the connections and activations in real-time.
